# postman-code-examples

This repository contains examples of using Postman Code. Each example was created by connecting the [Postman MCP Server](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server), `code` toolset, to a coding agent.

Each example includes its own README with conversation examples showing how the agent explored APIs, answered questions, or generated code. Where applicable, you'll also find setup instructions to run the example yourself.
