# postman-code-examples

This repository contains example applications built using Postman Code. Specifically, these applications were created by connecting the Postman MCP Server, `code` toolset, to a coding agent.

These examples aim to show how you can accomplish a few fundamental things with Postman Code:

- Search for APIs on Postman and explore them: both internal and public APIs
- Generate high-quality, API client code to consume APIs
- Consume API updates and regenerate client code

Each example includes its own README with conversation examples showing how the agent explored APIs, answered questions, or generated code. Where applicable, you'll also find setup instructions to run the example yourself.

## Example Apps

### Exploring

- [HubSpot API Explorer](./examples/hubspot-api-explorer/) — Ask questions about HubSpot's public API and get answers sourced directly from their Postman collections. Covers authentication, CRM objects, associations, and search.
- Internal Postman explorer - explore workspaces and collections inside of your personal or organization's Postman account
